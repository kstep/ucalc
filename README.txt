This is a port of original Unc: A Units Calculator for iOS to Android platform.
You can get original iOS product at
http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/unc/iphone/index.html and
http://itunes.apple.com/app/unc-professional-a-units-calculator/id401470814.

The copyright of the original product and the name belongs to Greenwood Software.

This port is distributed free of charge under LGPL or BSD license (so original
author can take it, change it and distribute on any conditions he likes).

This port is an early alpha and can't be considered finished and production
ready in any way (it's more of prototype quality really). Besides this port is
my first Android and Java experience, so don't blame me too much, I do as good
as I can. If you are a seasoned Android/Java developer and have any
propositions and improvements ideas report them to me, I'm ready to learn.

The copyright of the port's code belongs to me, Konstantin Stepanov
<me@kstep.me>, although idea and original iOS implementation belongs to
Greenwood Software and described above. Please refer to the links provided for
original iOS version. This is wonderful piece of software, believe me!
