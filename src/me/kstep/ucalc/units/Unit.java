 * This is a base unit class, which determines main Unit interface

 *
 * A Unit class represents a class of units, not some concrete unit.
 * To represent any actual unit one must instantiate Unit class child
 * with appropriate arguments.
 *
 * This is by design, and it allows to define units in run-time, e.g.
 * load units from resource files and produce new units based on already
 * existing units.
 *
 * Unit class is a rule, which determines a way given kind of units interact
 * with other units, but does not determine unit names or coefficients.
